This is just a simple boilerplate to manage classes models,views and controllers in php
It helps you have clean urls eg domain.com/about-us instead of domain.com/about-us.php
NOTE, you will need to modify config.php with your database correct details and the upload the database.sql into your database created
Most of the backend is fully developed. To create a new uri eg domain.com/new-page just go to controllers and create a class with the desired name newpage.php, copy another class and modify details as needed. Then go to models and do the same.
For frontend you will need your own designs in the views. Login, signup, password reset pages are fully developed in the backed and frontend, just change the designs as you may wish.
